# A simple chat system built with PHP and Ajax

### Live Demo:

This project is aimed at helping and supporting my learning process to master both front-end and back-end technologies. This time, I try some PHP and AJAX code in order to understand the basic structure of a simple chat system. 

In all my projects I love to give some attention to the UI, so I always end up learning some cool stuff on design and developing an eye for it.
